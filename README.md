# TextEditor

http://www.damienasp.com/ - This is the first project that I built at JustIt. 

It is a basic "Text Editor" built using ASP.NET (webforms), HTML, CSS, C#.

Buidling the app helped me to reinforce what I had learned in C# so far: arrays, loops, conditionals and methods.

There are five functions - 

1. A word and sentence count.
2. Slag converter.
3. Word Frequency.
4. Word search.
5. Detect expletives.
